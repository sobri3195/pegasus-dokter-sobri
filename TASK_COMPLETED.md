## Current System State

### Services Running

| Service | Status | Port | URL |
|---------|--------|------|-----|
| Backend API | ðŸŸ¢ Running | 5000 | http://localhost:5000 |
| Frontend UI | ðŸŸ¢ Running | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 |

### Connection Status

```
Browser â†’ Vite Proxy â†’ Backend â†’ Python Scanners
  :3000    /api/*      :5000      scanner.py
                                  advanced_scanner.py
                                  ultimate_scanner.py
```

**Overall Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY CONNECTED AND OPERATIONAL**

---

## Verification Commands

### Quick Check
```bash
npm run check
```

### Comprehensive Test
```bash
npm run test:connection
```

### Visual Status
```bash
npm run status
```

### Manual Tests
```bash
# Test backend directly
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","message":"Backend server is running"}

# Test through proxy
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected: Same as above

# Test all endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/scans
curl http://localhost:5000/stats
curl http://localhost:5000/trends
```

---

## How to Use

### 1. Access the Application

Open browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Verify Connection

In the "Scan Website" page, check the indicator in the top-right corner:
- **ðŸŸ¢ Backend Connected** = Everything working!
- **ðŸ”´ Backend Disconnected** = Backend not running
- **ðŸŸ¡ Checking Backend...** = Connection check in progress

### 3. Run a Scan

1. Enter target URL (e.g., https://example.com)
2. Choose scan mode:
   - Basic Scan (quick)
   - Advanced Scan (deep analysis)
   - Ultimate Scan (all features)
3. Click "Start Scan"
4. View results

---

## Maintenance

### Keep Services Running

Services are currently running in background. To restart:

```bash
# Start both services
npm start

# Or separately:
npm run backend  # Terminal 1
npm run dev      # Terminal 2
```

### Check Status Anytime

```bash
npm run status
```

### Troubleshooting

If connection fails:

1. Run comprehensive test:
   ```bash
   npm run test:connection
   ```

2. Check which test failed

3. Follow the fix instructions provided
