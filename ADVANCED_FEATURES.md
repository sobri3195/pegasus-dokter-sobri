### 3. Subdomain & Directory Enumeration

Discover hidden attack surfaces:

**Subdomain Enumeration:**
- DNS-based subdomain discovery
- Common subdomain patterns tested:
  - www, mail, ftp, admin, blog, dev, test, staging
  - api, portal, shop, store, mobile, m

**Directory Enumeration:**
- Scans for common directories:
  - `/admin`, `/administrator`, `/backup`, `/test`
  - `/api`, `/upload`, `/dashboard`, `/panel`
  - `/phpmyadmin`, `/console`
- HTTP status code analysis (200, 301, 302, 403)
- Risk level assessment for each discovered path

---

### 4. Common Vulnerability Signature Database

Local signature-based detection system:

**Database File:** `data/vuln_signatures.json`

**Signature Types:**
- XSS patterns (script tags, event handlers, javascript: protocol)
- SQL injection error messages (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL)
- Directory listing indicators
- Sensitive files (config files, backups, admin pages)
- Common vulnerabilities patterns

**Usage:**
Automatically loaded and matched against scan results. Can be updated manually for offline use.

### 5. Risk Scoring System

Comprehensive 0-100 security score:

**Severity Weights:**
- Critical: -15 points per finding
- High: -10 points per finding
- Medium: -5 points per finding
- Low: -2 points per finding

**Risk Levels:**
- 80-100: Safe (Green) ‚úÖ
- 60-79: Warning (Orange) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 0-59: Danger (Red) üî¥

**Display:**
- Large visual risk score indicator
- Color-coded severity breakdown
- Progress bar with dynamic coloring
- Summary statistics (Critical/High/Medium/Low counts)

---

### 6. Exploit Simulation (Safe Mode)

Non-destructive vulnerability validation:

**Safe Testing Methods:**
- Form field detection without actual injection
- Parameter reflection checking
- Error message analysis
- Pattern matching against known vulnerabilities

**Test Payloads (Not executed on target):**
- XSS: `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
- SQL: `' OR '1'='1`, `' UNION SELECT NULL--`

**Verification:**
All potential vulnerabilities marked as "verified: false" to indicate safe testing mode.

---

### 7. SSL & Certificate Analyzer

Detailed SSL/TLS security assessment:

**Analysis Points:**
- Certificate validity and expiration
- Issuer and subject information
- TLS version detection
- Cipher suite strength assessment
- Self-signed certificate detection
- Days until expiration countdown

**Security Checks:**
- Weak cipher detection (RC4, DES, 3DES)
- Expiration warnings (< 30 days)
- Self-signed certificate alerts
- HTTPS enforcement validation

---

### 8. Configuration & Header Hardening Report

Comprehensive security header analysis:

**Headers Checked:**
- ‚úÖ X-Frame-Options - Clickjacking protection
- ‚úÖ X-Content-Type-Options - MIME sniffing prevention
- ‚úÖ Strict-Transport-Security - HTTPS enforcement
- ‚úÖ Content-Security-Policy - XSS/injection prevention
- ‚úÖ X-XSS-Protection - Browser XSS filter
- ‚úÖ Referrer-Policy - Referrer information control
- ‚úÖ Permissions-Policy - Browser feature restrictions

**Cookie Security:**
- Secure flag presence
- HttpOnly flag validation
- SameSite attribute checking

**Server Information:**
- Version disclosure detection
- Banner information analysis

---

### 9. Vulnerability Trend Tracking

Historical analysis and visualization:

**Data Collection:**
- Automatic save of all scan results
- Timestamped vulnerability records
- Daily aggregation of findings

**Visualizations:**
1. **Line Chart:** Vulnerability trends over time
   - Critical, High, Medium, Low severity lines
   - Date-based x-axis
   
2. **Bar Chart:** Scan activity
   - Number of scans per day
   - Total vulnerabilities discovered

**Statistics:**

### Rate Limiting
Consider implementing:
- Request throttling for scans
- Timeout configurations
- Connection limits

### Legal & Ethical Use
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Only scan websites you own or have explicit permission to test.
