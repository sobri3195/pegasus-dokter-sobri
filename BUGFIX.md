# Bug Fix: Scan Failure - Backend Not Running

## Problem
Users were receiving the error message: "Failed to scan website. Make sure the backend server is running."

This error occurred even when the backend server was running due to:
1. **No proxy configuration**: Frontend (port 3000) couldn't reliably connect to backend (port 5000)
2. **Poor error handling**: Generic error messages didn't help identify the actual problem
3. **No health check**: No way to verify backend connectivity before attempting scans
4. **Direct localhost URLs**: Frontend was using hardcoded `http://localhost:5000` URLs which can cause CORS and connection issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Vite Proxy Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
```javascript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:5000',
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
  }
}
```
- All frontend requests to `/api/*` are now proxied to `http://localhost:5000/*`
- Eliminates CORS issues and improves reliability

### 2. Added Health Check Endpoint (`server.js`)
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Backend server is running' });
});
```
- Allows frontend to verify backend is running
- Used for connection status indicator

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Connection Handling (`ScanWebsite.jsx`)
- **Backend Status Monitoring**: Added `useEffect` hook to check backend status every 30 seconds
- **Visual Status Indicator**: Shows connection status with colored dot and text
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Backend Connected
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Backend Disconnected
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Checking Backend...
- **Pre-scan Validation**: Prevents scan attempts when backend is disconnected
- **Better Error Messages**: More specific error messages with actionable instructions
- **Improved Error Handling**: Catches and displays specific error messages from backend

### 4. Updated API Calls
Changed all API calls from direct localhost URLs to use the proxy:

**Before:**
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:5000/scan', ...)
```

**After:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/scan', ...)
```

Updated in:
- `src/pages/ScanWebsite.jsx` - Scan endpoints
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Stats and trends endpoints
- `src/pages/ScanResults.jsx` - Scans history endpoint

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can see backend connection status at a glance
2. **Clearer Error Messages**: Specific instructions when backend is not running
3. **More Reliable**: Proxy configuration eliminates CORS and connection issues
4. **Proactive Detection**: Health checks detect connection issues before scan attempts
5. **Production Ready**: Proxy configuration works better for deployment scenarios

## Testing Instructions

### Start the Application:
1. **Terminal 1** - Start backend:
   ```bash
   npm run scan
   ```

2. **Terminal 2** - Start frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Verify the Fix:
1. Check that the status indicator shows "Backend Connected" (green)
2. Try scanning a website (e.g., `https://example.com`)
3. Stop the backend server (Terminal 1: Ctrl+C)
4. Notice status indicator changes to "Backend Disconnected" (red)
5. Try to scan - should show helpful error message
6. Restart backend server
7. Status indicator should change back to "Backend Connected"

## Files Modified

1. `/server.js` - Added health check endpoint
2. `/vite.config.js` - Added proxy configuration
3. `/src/pages/ScanWebsite.jsx` - Enhanced error handling and status monitoring
4. `/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated API calls to use proxy
5. `/src/pages/ScanResults.jsx` - Updated API calls to use proxy

## Future Improvements

1. Add retry logic for failed requests
2. Add reconnection attempts when backend becomes available
3. Show notification when backend connection is restored
4. Add websocket support for real-time scan progress
5. Add backend startup script to automatically start both servers
