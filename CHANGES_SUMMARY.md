# Changes Summary - Fix Scan Failure Backend Connection Issue

## Issue
"Failed to scan website. Make sure the backend server is running." error was occurring due to connectivity issues between frontend and backend.

## Root Cause
- Frontend (port 3000) was making direct requests to backend (port 5000) without proxy
- No health check mechanism to verify backend status
- Poor error handling with generic error messages
- No visual feedback on backend connection status

## Changes Made

### 1. server.js
**Added:**
- Health check endpoint at `/health` to allow frontend to verify backend is running

```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Backend server is running' });
});
```

### 2. vite.config.js
**Added:**
- Proxy configuration to route `/api/*` requests to backend server
- Eliminates CORS issues and improves reliability

```javascript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:5000',
    changeOrigin: true,
    rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
  }
}
```

### 3. src/pages/ScanWebsite.jsx
**Added:**
- `backendStatus` state to track backend connection
- `useEffect` hook for periodic health checks (every 30 seconds)
- `checkBackendStatus()` function to verify backend availability
- Visual status indicator showing connection state (green/red/yellow dot)
- Pre-scan validation to prevent scans when backend is disconnected
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

**Modified:**
- Changed API calls from `http://localhost:5000/scan` to `/api/scan`
- Improved error messages with actionable instructions
- Better error parsing from backend responses

### 4. src/pages/Dashboard.jsx
**Modified:**
- Updated `loadStats()` to use `/api/stats` instead of `http://localhost:5000/stats`
- Updated `loadTrends()` to use `/api/trends` instead of `http://localhost:5000/trends`

### 5. src/pages/ScanResults.jsx
**Modified:**
- Updated `loadScans()` to use `/api/scans` instead of `/data/scans.json`
- Properly fetches scan history from backend API

## Impact
- ✅ Reliable connection between frontend and backend
- ✅ Users can see backend connection status in real-time
- ✅ Clear error messages when backend is not running
- ✅ Prevents scan attempts when backend is unavailable
- ✅ Eliminates CORS issues
- ✅ Better production deployment compatibility

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start backend with `npm run scan`
- [ ] Start frontend with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify "Backend Connected" indicator shows green
- [ ] Successfully scan a website (e.g., https://example.com)
- [ ] Stop backend server
- [ ] Verify "Backend Disconnected" indicator shows red
- [ ] Try to scan - should show helpful error message
- [ ] Restart backend
- [ ] Verify indicator returns to green
- [ ] Successfully scan again
